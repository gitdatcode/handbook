# CODE OF CONDUCT
_“The Community” in this document refers to the DatCode Community, found at http://www.datcode.io. “The Admin” refers to the administrators of the DatCode Community, which can be found in the [Team Directory](http://datcode.slack.com/?redir=%2Fteam). (you must be a member to view the directory)_

The Community is dedicated to providing an inclusive, harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

**This Code of Conduct applies to all The Community spaces, including public channels, private channels and direct messages (online and off), meetups, hackathons, conferences, social media, community standups, video conferences, podcasts, etc. Some of The Community spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.**

**Harassment includes:**
* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, or religion.
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of “dead” or rejected names.
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not
appropriate.
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like
“hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.
* Threats of violence.
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to
commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
* Deliberate intimidation

* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming
inappropriate levels of intimacy with others

* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent
except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse
* Publication of non-harassing private communication

**The Community will prioritize the safety of marginalized people over another person’s feelings of discomfort.**

**The following complaints will not be addressed:**
“Reverse”-isms, including “reverse racism,” “reverse sexism,” “reverse colorism” and “cisphobia”
* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”

## Reporting
If you are being harassed by a member of The Community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact @jermaine, @ann, or @emehrkay via direct message on slack.

This Code of Conduct applies to The Community spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of The Community outside of its spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by The Community members seriously, including harassment outside The Community spaces at any point in time. The Admin reserve the right to exclude people from The Community based on their past behavior, including behavior towards people who are not in The Community.

In order to protect volunteers from exhaustion, harassment and/or abuse, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.
We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At The Admin’s discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of The Community members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Administrative Action
Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behavior discussed herein are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in inappropriate behavior, **The Admin may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all The Community spaces and identification of the participant and their behavior to other members of The Community or the general public.**
