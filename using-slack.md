# Using Slack
Slack is a communication tool mostly used by companies for their workforce, but can also get the job done for communities. A chatroom-like experience divvied into what are called _channels_, our Slack group covers a range of topics. You can join a channel for **Javascript**, **copywriting**, **food**, or where you're going on your next adventure in the great **outdoors**.

A Slack group is customizable to fit your team's needs, and you can add useful apps and integrations to make the experience fun and productive. You can add them from Slack's app directory or make your own, like we did.

## do.bot
[do.bot](https://github.com/gitdatcode/do.bot) is the DATCODE Slack's do-everything-app bot. When we had too many integrations on our free tier, we made this to house whatever functionality we could think of. do.bot currently handles our onboarding and has a few useful commands developed by the community. Here's what we currently have:
* `/resource` - search DATCODE's resource database for links to helpful resources added by the community. You can also use this command to add your own resources.
* `/helpme` - request help on a problem you're having. The slash command takes tags (like "js," "python") and posts to the proper channels to get you some help.
* `/energy` - keep track of the ebb and flow of your feelings using emojis, and get a weekly report on it.
* `/lookup` - read something you have no idea what it is? Use this command and get the first Google search result. (results are posted to the `#lookups` channel)
* `/hype` - hype yourself or your homie! Send a message to the `#wakanda` channel and to our social media, promoting what cool thing you have to share.
* `/cap` - all caps, baby. Send your message in all caps to the channel.

## Some tips
* using `@here` will notify people that are logged in and are a part of the channel. If you have a question or need help on something, you can jump into the channel and start a conversation.
* try to avoid using `@channel`. This is will notify _everyone_ in the channel, and we don't want to bug people. If you'd like to make an announcement, please contact a [team member](https://github.com/gitdatcode/handbook/blob/master/using-slack.md).
* if you've missed a conversation and have something to add, create a thread! Just tap on the message you'd like to reply to and start one; you also have the option to send that message to the channel.
* there are a lot of notifications if you're in a lot of channels. Check your settings to turn some of the noise down, like setting the app to only send push notifications if you're mentioned.
* `@slackbot` is available if you need help with using Slack as well. Send a DM and ask it something.
