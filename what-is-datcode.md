# What is DATCODE?

DATCODE is a vibrant, inclusive community of Black and Brown technologists sharing knowledge, meeting new people, and doing the most.

Quite a few of us love to code, but tech isn't _just_ code, and we like to cover all of tech's facets -- from design to data science. We want to help those eager to learn find the perfect area to pique their interests and get them creating.

Our community has [active projects](http://github.com/gitdatcode/handbook/blob/master/active-projects.md) that anyone can contribute to as well as a [database of resources](http://resources.datcode.io), crowdsourced by our members, to help you learn and create. The DATCODE Slack group is the hub, where stories are shared and ideas are prodded and materialized.
